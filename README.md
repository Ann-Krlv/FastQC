# *QC-TError* - FastQC program analogue
> Python tool for basic statistics on quality of raw Illumina reads

## Introduction
*__QC-TError__* is a tool that you can use to get basic statistics on your raw Illumina reads. With help of it you can obtain
information regarding:
* basic statistics
  * length of reads presented in the data
  * total number of reads
  * average content of GC in sequence
  * number of reads that have poor quality
* visualtisation of:
  * average per base quality of reads
  * sequence quality per tile
  * distribution of average read quality score
  * per base sequence content
  * per sequence GC content
 
## Start
To start working with QC-Terror tools please download our package to your computer. To run QC-TError tool please type 
`python main.py` (or use your python3 interpreter) in project directory. 

## Example
You can do a test run on the data presented as a *example.fastq*.  The data was taken from from 
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/amp_res_2_fastq_zip/10006541

To see example of output you can type:

You can see the example of  created report *example.report* via

## Things that needed to be done:
* Basic statistics
  * create table in plots. - I didn't find yet way gow to create colored table in python *(but we can save tsv tables!)*
  * write function in stats. that would count how many reads did not path quality threshold (use from Fast filtrator)
  * add to main.py input to change default value for index for quality filter
* Per base sequence quality - __DONE A V__
* Per tile sequence quality __O__
* Per sequence quality scores __O__
  * Create plot on plots
* Per base sequence content __DONE V__
  * in stats create function
  * in plots create plot
* Per sequence GC content
  * create plot in plots - __V__ stuck
* Per base N content - *__maybe we can skip it?__*
* Sequence length distribution: __DONE V__
  * in start create counting
  * in plots build plot
*Sequence duplication levels __DONE A__
  * function in stats (use overrepresented stats)
  * plot
* Overrepresented sequences - __DONE A__
  * plot table
  * function in stats
*Adapter content *__to be skipped maybe?__*
* Combine everything into report
* Check and clean and add in README.md
* flake8 __DONE V__
* __Leonid__ don't forget to add your github page
* argparse __DONE A__

Data were taken from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/amp_res_2_fastq_zip/10006541
We also create example short file with 60 reads 'example_data.fastq' based on the library above

### Usage
1. To run program type `python main.py -i file.fastq` (or use your python3 interpreter) in project directory
2. If you want, you can specify output directory: `python main.py -i file.fastq -o path/to/dir`
3. Program will count the number of reads, create folder QCTerror_res and exit
4. All pictures and tables into QCTerror_res/pictures/ and QCTerror_res/tables/ folders
5. Enjoy :)
