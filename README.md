# *QC-TError* - FastQC program analogue
> Python tool for basic statistics on quality of raw Illumina reads

## Introduction
*__QC-TError__* is a tool that you can use to get basic statistics on your raw Illumina reads. With help of it you can obtain
information regarding:
* basic statistics
  * length of reads presented in the data
  * total number of reads
  * average content of GC in sequence
  * number of reads that have poor quality
* visualtisation of:
  * average per base quality of reads
  * sequence quality per tile
  * distribution of average read quality score
  * per base sequence content
  * per sequence GC content
 
## Start
To start working with QC-Terror tools please download our package to your computer. To run QC-TError tool please type 
`python main.py` (or use your python3 interpreter) in project directory. 

## Example
You can do a test run on the data presented as a *example.fastq*.  The data was taken from from 
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/amp_res_2_fastq_zip/10006541. This data was additionally corrected: it consist out of first 60 reads, some of them are also shorterned for purposes to see difference in the plot regarding reads_length.

To see example of output you can type:

You can see the example of  created report *example.report* via



Data were taken from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/amp_res_2_fastq_zip/10006541
We also create example short file with 60 reads 'example_data.fastq' based on the library above
